# SahulatApp
A location based service optimization system
It is developed in Laravel (Php), HTML, CSS, Javascript and MYSQL.
An application which provides detail about services available in a specific location in any country with their distances and ratings. The idea was to solve the problem of finding good service providers and to display best results based on cumulative ranking based on their ratings and distance.
Providers could add data about their services and people could rate them and search according to the ratings
